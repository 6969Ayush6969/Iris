***For first run***
1.copy and paste in terminal 
' pip install -r .\requirements.txt'

{in case error occured that  'cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system.'
To fix follow the steps:-

1.Run Microsoft Powershell as 'Run as administrator'
2.paste:  Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned       
(used remote signed  because its a bit more safe than unrestricted. It allows mostly local files to run)
3.run and type 'Y' 
now try activating the virtual environment, It will most probably run}


***To initialize***
-Run 'main.py' 
-Just say 'Iris'(Its not very accurate, It may take few attempts for it to reply), It will reply with a 'yes'.
-You may ask her to:
    1.open youtube
    2.open instagram
    3.you can add custom playlist at 'songplaylist.py'(Instruction given there)
    4.search any youtube channel(just say the channel name at last)
    5.open/search in google


***To finish program,say 'break'***

***Important points***
1.Terminal shows 'listening' and 'loading' so please speak after a second when it shows 'listening'
2.If continuous 'Error!' is showing,Please try to adjust mic and test it again
3.Between two consecutive listening their is time difference of two and a half seconds
